                    The website developer for this site! She was born in Cusco but raised in New Jersey and New York for most of her life. Often visiting her homecountry and learning something new about it each time. With her knowledge in coding she wanted to share her discoveries and wanted to give guides to fellow Americans who would love to visit someday and also explore areas of Cusco that are beyond tourist sites and taking you through my experience as a Peruvian American whos really proud of her home country. <br><br>

I enjoyed every year the different sponsers  would dress their saint and would decorate them with offerings that deal with their religion. My favorite was Belen, a sturdy made of silver base heavy you can see the poeple who carry her be so tired. It was an event that many people go but it isnt impossible to get around and get a good view since the saints are so huge</p>
