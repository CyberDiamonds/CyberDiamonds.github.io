                        <p>the lovely evenn of corpus cristi was something that is always a facinating type of parade. I enjoyed every year the different sponsers  would dress their saint and would decorate them with offerings that deal with their religion. My favorite was Belen, a sturdy made of silver base heavy you can see the poeple who carry her be so tired. It was an event that many people go but it isnt impossible to get around and get a good view since the saints are so huge</p>
