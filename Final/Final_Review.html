                <p> Cusco is the most pupullar in the months of June and July here you can find my reviews towards the <a href = "https://peruvian-sunrise.com/blog/june-celebrations-cusco">June events</a> I went within last year hosted in Cusco City! Note that for all of these events it is recomended you stay aware of your surroundings as robberies can occur in these crowds. With that said you can have a busy schedule filled as parades, the whole month enjoy seeing art floats, dances, large concert and firework show for free!</p>

                    <p><b>A religious event that consists of dedicated young and old peruvians to carry the saint statues from the main temple in Cusco in the Plaza de Armas. This yearly event has a lot of history that you can read more in Peru Travel's official site <a href= "https://www.peru.travel/en/events/corpus-christi">HERE!</a></b></p>

                            This event is really fun to witness as the poeple who carry these heavy statues are in charge of decorating each of the <a href="https://www.salkantaytrekking.com/blog/corpus-christi-in-cusco-a-religious-and-cultural-feast/">saints</a> differently each year. The event itself last a total of days, where if you miss one day going somewhere you can witness their farewell, race, and dance events that happen. The plaza gets filled and if you want a close look of the statues you can either be near the path of where they carry the statues into the  <a href ="https://www.cuscoperu.com/en/travel/cusco/temples-convents/basilica-cathedral-of-cusco/#ATTRACTIONS">main cathedral </a>  or inside the cathedral itself where they will all be gathered to rest. My mother said that they take them there and they would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LGMU9p5MBw">gossip</a> to eachother. Unfortunately no photography is allowed inside any cathedral however that just means youll have to go and see yourself it really is mezmerizing to see every detail up close! </p>

                            Now because it is a loong event during the afternoon good luck trying to find a taxi that will take you to the plaza or even try and get out of the plaza. Busses will be full, restaurants will be booked and hard to get a balcony view. It was also difficult to find bathrooms so be wary of how much liquid you intake and definetly go before leaving your place of stay. In this even you have to be very wary of your surroundings and wait to cross or move around when the statues are close to you. As there will be a lot of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP86UgXNy/">pushing and yelling</a> and perhaps a whip being whiplashed on the floor if you do are too close to them. It definetly for your own good because the statues are very heavy and momentum is very hard to stop so be careful and don't get distracted on the view of your phone like I did. I had to run out the way the band music getting louder snapped me out of it but it was a great picture of Belen that I got that day of their departure of the main cathedral. She was stunninng with her glistening pure silver base.</p>

                        This event is one of the most popular for locals and tourists for good reason as there is so many participants that show off the Inca sacred ritual for free! This is a <a href="https://www.perurail.com/peruvian-holidays/all-you-need-to-know-about-inti-raymi/">public event</a> that is highly recomended to see as every year it is a show that starts all the way from <a href="https://www.peru.travel/en/masperu/sacsayhuaman-an-imposing-jewel-of-pre-hispanic-engineering">Saqsayhuaman</a> to the <a href="https://www.peruhop.com/coricancha-sun-temple/">Qorikancha Temple</a> and finally to the Plaza de Armas. There is a show with music, dances, and a parade where they carry the Inca and the princesses. Even the govenor had to attend as he will be talked with the Inca. It lasts for a good while and you can catch a glimpse if you didn;t have a good spot after the main speech is held and the people go off around the plaza dancing and the worriors march. There will be plenty of food vendors where you can grab a snack or drinik while you wait for the performers to arrive.</p>

                        While this is an important tradition and many people will participate in this recreation iut is very very important you get there early if you want a good spot. Since I live a little away from the plaza it was really hard to find a <a href="https://www.theonlyperuguide.com/peru-guide/cusco/getting-around/">taxi</a> that was willing to go through the traffic to get near the area. Streets will be closed and if you make it even an hour before you will have a hard time to get throughg the many people that have already settled with their kids, stools. So come early or you will miss out on a good view. I couldn't get good pictures due to arriving a little too late (even though we were early). Another downside is that if you do not know quechua you will not understand a thinkg they say I was lucky to have been with my mother fot this as she was able to translate it for me. It is a language that does not have live translation taken in place so you will just have to admire how accurate the display is as they will talk in quechua and sing in quechua as well.</p>
