                <p>This will always be your starting point to your trip to Cusco after you depart the capital of Peru, Lima you will arrive here! As soon as you leave the air port you will be greeted by a ton of people that will offer taxis. Depending on where you are staying there may be designated drivers ro drop you off at your hotel. If you are a local and know your address you can always walk out of the airport gates and a little down the block negotiate a better price to your staying destination. <br><br>
                
                When departing the airport is not that very big you can find charging stations here and also small cafe to grab a snack or sandwhich. Id save my money and perfer to bring in snacks from my local store and take that with me you are allowed to take food from cusco to lima however the restrictions get applied in lima where you cannot take and meat, cheese, or of that nature for further check in check with TSA regulations.</p>

                <p>This is the cutest cafe you can visit, if you are a fan of cats of course. Its a cat cafe that is near the plaza where you can eat with the cats or observe them from a window. The wait time isnt so bad but check their opening hours as they are not open all week. The cats here are adorable and adoptable. Very fun place for a dat and to take pictures with cat decorations while enjoying some peruvian quisine like llomo saltado or something sweet like crepes and smoothies.</p>

Bring your bug spray and comfortable shoes as you will walk alot in this city. They have banned the use of cars in the city and tehre will be a lot of bikes and carriges. Busses are the only allowed that transport people to the mountain Machupichhu it is really an unforgettable sight.

                <p>One of my favorite places to go visit it is a fun hike as you climb the stairs of the saced ruins that are left behind. You can find stones with preserved engravings of a puma. It was a farming ground for the incas and you can learn more about how they irrigated the land using water from the mountains. The city of ollantaytambo is filled with sounds of rushing waters. You can stay here and get soothed to sleep here you can also find a car that can take you to the train station to go to Machu Picchu.</p>

                <p>It is one of the common places you can go to to enjoy another incan remains huge stones that were once temples destroyed by the Spainards. As you see the stones they will remind you of the stones around the streets of the plaza and youd be correct to assume that it is from the same rock. The destruction was made to place the stones as roads from the spainards. Saqsayhuaman is facinating with views and have llamas roaming around make sure to take pictures.</p>

                <p>This is another preserved ruins from before the incans. This was a place that is not built the same as the other mentioned ruins. The stones are smaller and have a red hue, bring your comfortable shoes because this one is also quite a walk but not too much of a hike like the rest of the ruins.</p>
