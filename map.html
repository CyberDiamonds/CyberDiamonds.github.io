            <h2>Lima Capitol</h2>
                <p>The capital of Peru, as of now it is the only airport to get to Cusco. An airport is in in the works to have direct flights to cusco so that is exciting. Here you can take a couple of days and enjoy plenty of the beutiful side of Lima which is Miraflores mostly. Here you can enjoy the heart of food if you want to try good cuisine here would be the place as there are many restaurants and highly trained chefs here. The downside is that it is quite dangerous for tourists and even for locals. So be very aware of your surroundings and don't get lost and fall into tourist traps. And be prepared for the long traffic it is probably worse than new york!</p>
