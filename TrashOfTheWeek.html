<h1 id="preface-section">Preface</h1>
	
	<!-- A text of about 2 - 5 short paragraphs
	addressing the question, 
	- Why did you decide to record and share each week of your trash?
	- should be at least 200 words
	-->
	
	<p>Why record and share about my trash? Well I have found out that we can always learn more about ourselves if we just take a moment to think about it. Some track their meals others activity level, well why not trash? It is something that we do almost without thinking too much about besides is this done with its value? Then we trash it or give it a different purpose but there are things we can learn about ourselves in the process of taking a moment and ask yourself what does throwing this away say about me.</p>

	<!-- A text about 4 - 6 paragraphs  
- 1st is breif narrative summary of the week's dsposal activity compare probs to previous week, note problems, describe changes, view of project, habits, patterns you notice
    -->
    <p>This week is an interesting one, valentines happened this week and besides the hefty amount of chocolate wrappers were thrown out there were a couple of more sentimental objects here. I notice that I throw out a mjority of food items still but manage to find other people's trash and make it work for me instead of following through their intention. This project has made me also dig deeper within my stored items because I notice that I get sentimentally attached to many things and causes my endless stored clutter.</p>
	
	<!-- 
	- 2nd should organize and describe the discarded items or waste you've recorded for the week
	-->
	<p>This week's items are the following: Ring Box, Heart Bracelet, press on nails, school doodles, phone filling, cat litter, face mask, hand cream, and lastly hair ties. Lets dive in and find out the connections I encountered.</p>
	
	<!--

	<div id="item_of_the_week">
      <p>The item is an old wallet I have had for many years I would say about plus 7 years approximately. It's dark brown and leathery uite hefty and big for a now empty wallet. I acquired it when I was deep cleaning a storage space of mine and found this wallet along with a black smaller one. This one is going to the trash because the black one I could reuse and this one just is too big. Also the leather is peeling off on the inside so too old aswell.</p>
      
      <img alt = "profile" src="Wallet.jpg" width="265px">
      
      <p>What i found out about the wallet is that it is a Buxton, and has a velvet tough cowhide exterior. They are still a running buissness and advocate for responsible resourcing according to their website. </p>
      
      <a href="http://buxtonwallets.org/">Buxtonwallets.org Links to an external site. </a>
      
      <p>As for my specific wallet it was hard to find the exact one I had must be an very old model and has an accessory clip that you can add more pockets into your wallet for cards or spare house keys even. The Buxton company originated from Dana Buxton and Julia Buxton. </p>

      <p>I found that J. Buxton also released a series of colorful wallet designs for women too. There in the magazines I can see that they look similar to the one I have with an accessory pouch just that mine is brown. She created designs that had subtle designs to not attract much attention but to also stand out from other wallets. </p>
