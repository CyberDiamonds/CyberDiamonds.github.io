<!-- A text of about 2 - 5 short paragraphs
	addressing the question, 
	- Why did you decide to record and share each week of your trash?
	- should be at least 200 words
	-->
	
	<p>Why record and share about my trash? Well I have found out that we can always learn more about ourselves if we just take a moment to think about it. Some track their meals others activity level, well why not trash? It is something that we do almost without thinking too much about besides is this done with its value? Then we trash it or give it a different purpose but there are things we can learn about ourselves in the process of taking a moment and ask yourself what does throwing this away say about me.</p>
	
	<h1 id="overview-section">Overview</h1>

<!-- A text about 4 - 6 paragraphs  
- 1st is breif narrative summary of the week's dsposal activity compare probs to previous week, note problems, describe changes, view of project, habits, patterns you notice
    -->
	
    <p>This week is an interesting one, valentines happened this week and besides the hefty amount of chocolate wrappers were thrown out there were a couple of more sentimental objects here. I notice that I throw out a mjority of food items still but manage to find other people's trash and make it work for me instead of following through their intention. This project has made me also dig deeper within my stored items because I notice that I get sentimentally attached to many things and causes my endless stored clutter.</p>
	
	<!-- 
	- 2nd should organize and describe the discarded items or waste you've recorded for the week
	-->
	<p>This week's items are the following: Ring Box, Heart Bracelet, press on nails, school doodles, phone filling, cat litter, face mask, hand cream, and lastly hair ties. Lets dive in and find out the connections I encountered.</p>
	
	<!--
	- divide 9 items into 3 to 4 groups on common properteies 
	ex. unwanted gifts, broken objects, thinks belonging to ex, metal objects
	-->
	<h2>Acts of Love</h2>
	<!--
		- Ring Box 
		- Heart Bracelet
		- School Doodles
	-->
	<p>These objects have once signified an act of love. They all hold a memory of past partners. A ring box that I once used to store the ring he gave to me one day I have no idea where the ring is but I kept the box and found it in my collection of other boxes that I stored to resuse maybe one day to gift to someone else. A heat bracelet given to me also as a gift for possibly valentines or a monthaversary cause he was a gifter. I remember other bracelets I recieved but I couldn't find those in the jewelry box in which I found this one. I remember having a drawing of this thats how much I cared for thse gifts just acts of love that I liked and wanted to show value for. However I found myself later on just storing this after too many incidents in losing some of my jewelery gifts I felt unworthy to wear them and kept them hidden and safe where id never lose them. School doodles I have so many that no matter how many times I go over my doodle folder I could never get myself to throw away. I just its a part of me to have these doodles as memories of how I was in highschool. You can tell that my relationship impacted me a lot and I glossed over so many things I probably wouldn't like so I guess we can let go of it and keep it as a take away or convert it as another type of art thatd be a nice idea. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Other People's Trash</h2>
	<!--
		- hair ties
		- phone filling
		- cat litter
	-->
	
	<p>These are objects that do not necesarily come from me but just things I come across. Hair ties I have noticed the amount of hair ties that are just scattered in college I have fun finding them and instead of throwing them out either collecting reusing them cause if they are not broken they are perfectly fine after a wash use it to wrap my cabels or lately my mom uses them to make crochet headbands. Phone filling so at work I configure work phones for the company and i basically unpack and re pack the phones with new screen proctector and phone case. What is always left is the boxes and what comes with a new phone, I end up crumpling up the boxes to then use as package filling for other packages we send over. Its just a good use of that trash when we don't have any air bubbles for packaging. Cat litter now this is a daily throw away that my kitties need throwing of to have a fresh litter box. I wonder what they think of when suddnley their human is scooping their poop and putting into a bag and its out of sight for them.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Self Care Items</h2>
	<!--
		- facemask
		- hand cream
		- press on nails
	-->
	
	<p> Pretty self explainatory this group, just self care items for me. Face mask especially pusheen I was so excited to find this because I love pusheen but they are expensive so to find this facemask set for only $3 was a bargain. I can't just get rid of the packaging tho i will clean and cut out the pictures to go in my cut outs because I love their Pushhen art! Hand cream now these were found deep stored in my bathroom, probably from our old move and just have been stored cause its cream just products with the potential of maybe ill use it one day I sorted most and kept some but threw away a lot of them cause they just don't smell that nice. But further thinking about it maybe it isn't a good idea to keep them either cause who knows where it has been or what ingredients may just be spoiled in hand cream. I try to convince myself it is not wasteful but a safe option to throw these creams out despite me wanting to keep them. Lastly press on nails, most of these pakcaged nail sets have more than ten nails and sure as it would help people have a variation of nail sizes it does generate a lot of waste but I can't really get myself to shape these nails individually so i just decide to let go of them. But i love nails they are such a fun way to boost my mood and feel pretty but they sure get in the way of everything thus I enjoy its reusability as in i can just glue back on or not.

      <p>What i found out about the wallet is that it is a Buxton, and has a velvet tough cowhide exterior. They are still a running buissness and advocate for responsible resourcing according to their website. </p>
      
      <a href="http://buxtonwallets.org/">Buxtonwallets.org Links to an external site. </a>
      
      <p>As for my specific wallet it was hard to find the exact one I had must be an very old model and has an accessory clip that you can add more pockets into your wallet for cards or spare house keys even. The Buxton company originated from Dana Buxton and Julia Buxton. </p>

      <p>I found that J. Buxton also released a series of colorful wallet designs for women too. There in the magazines I can see that they look similar to the one I have with an accessory pouch just that mine is brown. She created designs that had subtle designs to not attract much attention but to also stand out from other wallets. </p>
