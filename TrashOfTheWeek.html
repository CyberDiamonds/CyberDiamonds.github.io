			<p><img id = "preface-image" alt = "ME!" src="images/profile.svg" width="300px" style="float: left"> Why record and share about my trash? Well I have found out that we can always learn more about ourselves if we just take a moment to think about it. Some track their meals others activity level, well why not trash? It is something that we do everyday as we are always in that cycle of consume, store, and dispose. The items that we store can be a memory holder to certain times of our lives and when we throw it away can represent a new era starting. Tracking our trash opens us up to notice patterns in the things we consume. Extra packaging, food containers, stored items, and junk become trash if you no longer have a connection to the item anymore as you had when you first got it. In slowing down and examining our trash we can also have time to think about its disposal like, can I reuse this? Can I give it a different purpose? Or if it had sentimental value how can I store it in a way that isn't physical but can honor it in a different way? This way, we can slow down and maybe change our consumption, storage, and disposal ways so that we can be more mindful about our trash and the memories they hold. </p>

	<!-- A text about 4 - 6 paragraphs  
	- 1st is breif narrative summary of the week's dsposal activity compare probs to previous week, note problems, describe changes, view of project, habits, patterns you notice
    -->
	
    <p>This week is an interesting one, valentines happened this week and besides the hefty amount of chocolate wrappers were thrown out there were a couple of more sentimental objects here. I notice that I throw out a majority of food items at a daily but an interesting trash I find are other people's litter. I then make it work for me instead of following through and throwing it away. This project has made me also dig deeper within my stored items because I notice that I get sentimentally attached to many things and causes my endless stored clutter.</p>
	
	<!-- 
	- 2nd should organize and describe the discarded items or waste you've recorded for the week
	-->
	<p>This week's items are the following: Ring Box, Heart Bracelet, press on nails, school doodles, phone filling, cat litter, face mask, hand cream, and lastly hair ties. Lets dive in and find out the connections I encountered. I purposely left out the large amount of chocolate wrappers I gathered from consuming those chocolates but they will get their honorable mention. Now these items have a variety in stored items I find in storage places at home. Others come from my work where I always get packages and send out packages and am in charge of inventory. And lastly from walking around campus 3 places I go on the daily.</p>
	
	<!--
	- divide 9 items into 3 to 4 groups on common properteies 
	ex. unwanted gifts, broken objects, thinks belonging to ex, metal objects
	-->
		<h2>Acts of Love</h2>
	<!--
		- Ring Box 
		- Heart Bracelet
		- School Doodles
	-->
	<p>These objects have once signified an act of love. They all hold a memory of past partners. A <a href="">ring box</a> that I once used to store the ring he gave to me one day I have no idea where the ring is but I kept the box and found it in my collection of other boxes that I stored to resuse maybe one day to gift to someone else.
	<br> A <a href=""> heart bracelet</a> given to me also as a gift for possibly valentines or a monthaversary cause he was a gifter. I remember other bracelets I recieved but I couldn't find those in the jewelry box in which I found this one. I remember having a drawing of this thats how much I cared for thse gifts just acts of love that I liked and wanted to show value for. However I found myself later on just storing this after too many incidents in losing some of my jewelery gifts I felt unworthy to wear them and kept them hidden and safe where id never lose them.
	<br><a href ="">School doodles</a>I have so many that no matter how many times I go over my doodle folder I could never get myself to throw away. I just its a part of me to have these doodles as memories of how I was in highschool. You can tell that my relationship impacted me a lot and I glossed over so many things I probably wouldn't like so I guess we can let go of it and keep it as a take away or convert it as another type of art thatd be a nice idea.</p>
	
		<h2>Other People's Trash</h2>
	<!--
		- hair ties
		- phone filling
		- cat litter
	-->
	
	<p>These are objects that do not necesarily come from me but just things I come across. <a href = "">Hair ties</a> I have noticed the amount of hair ties that are just scattered in college I have fun finding them and instead of throwing them out either collecting reusing them cause if they are not broken they are perfectly fine after a wash use it to wrap my cabels or lately my mom uses them to make crochet headbands. 
	<br><a href = "">Phone filling</a> so at work I configure work phones for the company and I basically unpack and re pack the phones with new screen proctector and phone case. What is always left is the boxes and what comes with a new phone, I end up crumpling up the boxes to then use as package filling for other packages we send over. Its just a good use of that trash when we don't have any air bubbles for packaging. 
	<br><a href="">Cat litter</a> now this is a daily throw away that my kitties need throwing of to have a fresh litter box. I wonder what they think of when suddnley their human is scooping their poop and putting into a bag and its out of sight for them.
	</p>
	
		<h2>Self Care Items</h2>
	<!--
		- facemask
		- hand cream
		- press on nails
	-->
	
	<p> Pretty self explainatory this group, just self care items for me. <a href ="">Face mask</a> especially pusheen I was so excited to find this because I love pusheen but they are expensive so to find this facemask set for only $3 was a bargain. I can't just get rid of the packaging tho i will clean and cut out the pictures to go in my cut outs because I love their Pushhen art! 
	<br><a href = "">Hand cream</a> now these were found deep stored in my bathroom, probably from our old move and just have been stored cause its cream just products with the potential of maybe ill use it one day I sorted most and kept some but threw away a lot of them cause they just don't smell that nice. But further thinking about it maybe it isn't a good idea to keep them either cause who knows where it has been or what ingredients may just be spoiled in hand cream. I try to convince myself it is not wasteful but a safe option to throw these creams out despite me wanting to keep them. 
	<br>Lastly <a href="">press on nails</a>, most of these pakcaged nail sets have more than ten nails and sure as it would help people have a variation of nail sizes it does generate a lot of waste but I can't really get myself to shape these nails individually so i just decide to let go of them. But i love nails they are such a fun way to boost my mood and feel pretty but they sure get in the way of everything thus I enjoy its reusability as in i can just glue back on or not. </p>

		<div id="item_of_the_week">
		  <p>The item of the week is Press On Nails!</p>

		  <p>I selected this item for the item of the week because this item really joggled my memories and also helped me learn somthing about myeslf I haven't realized. Press on nails something that I considered scary before I got to try them myself I have learned to really love them and helped me give me confidence. Taking a moment to figure out which memory these nails made me have was when I asked my partner at the tkme that what were his thoughts on me trying them on. He quickly said no they are scary don't ever wear them around me and I was devastated and kind of just let it be a thing I couldn't wear cause I didn't want to scare him. Well now that it has been some time now I thank these nails that once used to be something i forbid myself to try now I can wear them whenever I want.
		  <br>These nails specifically have been used as my first time nails I always wanted these metallic colors I thought they were so unique and they are! So many compliments and also cheap got them really added to my outfits and also helped me stop picking at my skin so much. So thanks for being a part of a meaningful change in my self confidence and I can't wait to try out so many more designs or eventually create my own</p>

		<p>Well finally we can end this week and start anew. We have gone through many of my memories that thankfully I was able to revive by taking time to slow down and think about the things I hold dear. This record will be kept here with me if I ever need a reminder but the item will be gone and thus its time to move on. Collect more things that will follow me throughout my life like my memories.</p>
