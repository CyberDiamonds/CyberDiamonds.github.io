		<p>Before this project I have been thinking on how we really do have a trash problem. As many authors have stated it is just something that is part of our lives because we in our era consume things buy things from others and recieve it or pick it up from a location that packages it for us to take it. Every isle with necessities come in packages, foods , medication, hygenic items. Everything has packaging.</p>

		<p>I went on the bus and noticed the amount of trash that just i can catch with my eyes laying under the bridge that greenery area. From bags from chip bags from plastic cups. These all came from somewhere people are selling and people are buying trash comes from things that we buy almost all the time. But it is hard to tell or expect a company that is making a lot of money from selling their product. Imagine taking out all the production of the water bottles, we have so many brands for the same item. The problem that they solve is that it is a lightwight item that allows you to take water on the go. Sure but we can use waterbottles that come in metal, plastic as well.</p>
		
		<p>So it just taces us to more products that do the same thing and the consumers are us, so what can we do? well it is up to the consumers right that can make change but we cannot let companies get away with so much wastage, we have government deal with our trash but that sort of becomes a mess when you have recycling bins and poeple still don't respect the way they are set up to be recuclyed. Others just decide not to recycle at all.</p>
