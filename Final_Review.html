                        This event is really fun to witness as the poeple who carry these heavy statues are in charge of decorating each of the saints differently each year. The event itself last a total of days, where if you miss one day going somewhere you can witness their farewell, race, and dance events that happen. The plaza gets filled and if you want a close look of the statues you can either be near the path of where they carry the statues into the main church or inside the church itself where they will all be gathered. My mother said that they take them there and they would gossip to eachother.</p>

                        Now because it is a lonng event during the afternoon good luck trying to find a taxi that will take you to the plaza or even try and get out of the plaza. Busses will be full, restaurants will be booked and hard to get a balcony view. It was alsodifficult to find bathrooms so be wary of how much liquid you intake and definetly go before leaving your place of stay. In this even you have to be very wary of your surroundings and wait to cross or move around when the statues are close to you. As there will be a lot of pushing and yelling and perhaps a whip being whiplashed on the floor if you do are too close to them. </p>
