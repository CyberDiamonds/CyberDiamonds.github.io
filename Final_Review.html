                    <p><b>A religious event that consists of dedicated young and old peruvians to carry the saint statues from their home chourch. This yearly event has a lot of history that you can read more of here! --> </b></p>

                        This event is really fun to witness as the poeple who carry these heavy statues are in charge of decorating each of the saints differently each year. The event itself last a total of days, where if you miss one day going somewhere you can witness their farewell, race, and dance events that happen. The plaza gets filled and if you want a close look of the statues you can either be near the path of where they carry the statues into the main church or inside the church itself where they will all be gathered. My mother said that they take them there and they would gossip to eachother.</p>

                        <p>the lovely evenn of corpus cristi was something that is always a facinating type of parade. I enjoyed every year the different sponsers  would dress their saint and would decorate them with offerings that deal with their religion. My favorite was Belen, a sturdy made of silver base heavy you can see the poeple who carry her be so tired. It was an event that many people go but it isnt impossible to get around and get a good view since the saints are so huge</p>
