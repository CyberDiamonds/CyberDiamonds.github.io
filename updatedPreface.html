			<h2>Why record and share about my trash?</h2>
			<p>Well I have found out that we can always learn more about ourselves if we just take a moment to think about it. Some track their meals others activity level, well why not trash? It is something that we do everyday as we are always in that cycle of consume, store, and dispose. The items that we store can be a memory holder to certain times of our lives and when we throw it away can represent a new era starting. Tracking our trash opens us up to notice patterns in the things we consume. Extra packaging, food containers, stored items, and junk become trash if you no longer have a connection to the item anymore as you had when you first got it. In slowing down and examining our trash we can also have time to think about its disposal like, can I reuse this? Can I give it a different purpose? Or if it had sentimental value how can I store it in a way that isn't physical but can honor it in a different way? This way, we can slow down and maybe change our consumption, storage, and disposal ways so that we can be more mindful about our trash and the memories they hold. 
			</p>
			
			<p>It is interesting what you can find out about the past based on the trash that was left behind. There is a huge difference from the trash now vs the trash then but one of the things we can find in common is that these things have served their use and thats is why we can find </p>
