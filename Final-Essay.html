                <p> The exciting date is getting near and I already can taste the fresh air and good food. I will be traveling with only my mother this year and we are going to Cusco without much of a plana and decided we will be flexible about this trip. As she will have dates where she will go out with friends and family and I will go out with my friends I met last trip. </p>
                <p>So what have I packed? I have seperated into 5 categories, sleep/home clothes, for the cold weather, hot weather, and late night out. Its going to be only for a week so not much needs packing but the essentials are a jacket with inside pockets (This is very useful to avoid being robbed, especially in busses). A string bag, these are usefull for when you go out in the streets and maybe you find yourself buying something it is easiert to carry a string book bag than carry a bag/purse. Comfortable shoes, perferably not your nicest pair, I find that your shoes will get absolutely demolished when you go hiking or even at the plaza they will get dirst fast! </p>
                <p>So we have our essentials packed and ready check in early and have a cozy outfit to last in the plane for 8 whole hours.</p>

        <h3>Peru at Last!: Lima Stay of one day</h3>
        <div class="essay-card">
            <div class="essay-txt">
            <p>Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep in the plane after the stress of getting to your gate on time and to check that it is the gate you are supposed to be going since JFK airport is so big. But overall now that we landed it is time to relax a little and rest at my uncles house. He has prepared us some fried fish it was a questionable taste but its Lima the costal area of Peru it was the freshest fish and filled me up quick.</p>
            <p>Since we are here for a short vacation we will only have time to go out for lunch together and try the delicious Pollo a la brasa. When I tell you this will change your life it will change your life it is cooked so well and the side of fries makes it perfection. It is known that Lima has one oof the best foods its really competitive hear and for good reason. With this we prepare our bags to head out early to Lima airport</p>
            <p>There is nothing like leaving Lima because once you get through the thick clouds, and humid air you are Greeted with a beautiful blue sky and it geets even preetier and clearer in Cusco. That is when its June season since this is a November trip it won't be as sunny and bright everyday but it will be beautiful and green in contrast to June when its dry season. The flight Duration will be of One hour, we ll soon rise to the highest of the Andes.</p>

        <div class="essay-list">
            <ul>
              <li>Because the United states altitude is about the same as Lima here is where the altitude sickness comes in</li>
              <li>You can buy altitube pills to help with the symptoms that include : shortness of breath, dizzyness, and fever</li>
              <li>Acclimate yourself with some Coca Tea a lot of it!</li>
              <li>Beware of food poisoning, it is likely your stomach won't be used to the food here so pepto bismal is a must </li>

                <p> The first day is always exciting its literally coming back home away from the city and away from the US, where at a not so far distance you can see the mountains. The people here speak mostly spanish but luckily since there are many tourists that come by you can find help in English if needed at the airport or other tourist spots.  </p>
                <p>Once we reach home we unpack our clothes and catch up with the family. First things first we go to the molino to get a beuty tocuh up. Which includes nails and treading. Our home is also a combination of a laundrymat and salon so a heair cut as well will be needed. We got to look good for the photographs.  </p>
                <p>The molino is the spot where locals will buy their vegetables, meat,and even prepared food, home supplies, and even tech (Beware though you can't be sure of their origin so stay safe and buy tech from official stores). Basically its a huge walmart where you can find and buy most things.  </p>
