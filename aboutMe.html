Hiya im Budder! Thanks for checking my stuff out! A little about me I am a 22 yr old student that loves art and is majoring in Computer Science in Rutgers. I have taken a huge interest in discovering new forms of art, and love pushing my knowledge and understanding of what art is. I love sharing my discoveries with the internet, and recording my improvement in art because why not! Memento mori afterall.</p>
