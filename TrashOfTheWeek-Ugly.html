	<h2><em>Out With the Old and New </em></h2>
	
	<p>The item is an old wallet I have had for many years I would say about plus 7 years approximately. It's dark brown and leathery uite hefty and big for a now empty wallet. I acquired it when I was deep cleaning a storage space of mine and found this wallet along with a black smaller one. This one is going to the trash because the black one I could reuse and this one just is too big. Also the leather is peeling off on the inside so too old aswell.</p>

	<p>What i found out about the wallet is that it is a Buxton, and has a velvet tough cowhide exterior. They are still a running buissness and advocate for responsible resourcing according to their website. </p>

	<p>As for my specific wallet it was hard to find the exact one I had must be an very old model and has an accessory clip that you can add more pockets into your wallet for cards or spare house keys even. The Buxton company originated from Dana Buxton and Julia Buxton. </p>

	<p>I found that J. Buxton also released a series of colorful wallet designs for women too. There in the magazines I can see that they look similar to the one I have with an accessory pouch just that mine is brown. She created designs that had subtle designs to not attract much attention but to also stand out from other wallets. </p>

	<!-- Youw ill need to add in page navigation by adding id tags to objects
		id attributes section headings get an id tag
		add nav tags <nav> <a href="#sec-preface"></a></nav> 
		you can add | after the link just for aesthetic purposes add links for the rest of the sections of your webpage for the top of the page you add a href="#" 
		
	-->
	
	<!-- Raster files Files: how many up and down vertically color grid in a photoshop
		dont use gif 
		glossy dense enormous photograph compressed 
		when you save it as a jpeg you can see the minimal compression but retains all the data 
		lots smaller but has some compression where you lose image quality 
		png is good if you have small number of colors few 100 colors 
		use WebP you will need some compression
		you coulld do png but no just JPG or WebP and vector images
		Which is great for logos or stylized lettering scalable without any data loss
